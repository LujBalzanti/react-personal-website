            <p class="light-text main-body text-left"> 
              I was born in Slovenia in 1996 and I currently work from the UK as a Software Engineer at ZTP. 
            </p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-left">
              I am a fast learner and a driven self-starter. I moved to the UK in March 2020 and spent the COVID-19 lockdown deepening my knowledge of Software Engineering. I finished <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript">CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a>, the Harvard Courses offered on edx.com.</p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-left">
              I greatly enjoy learning and constantly look to expand my knowledge with new challenges. Oftentimes, I will look to work with frameworks I'm not yet familiar with - I will try them out on personal projects or on software katas.
            </p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-left">
              I am logic driven and adept at working under pressure. I am good at fast-paced, detail-oriented and precise communication.</p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-left">  
              I won a World Championship for Prismata, and I also reached the top 0.1% of players in multiple games, including League of Legends, Hearthstone, and Gwent. I strongly enjoy games which are strategic and force quick decision making.</p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-left"> 
              My personal interests go well beyond games, though - I also enjoy weightlifting, hiking, cooking, baking, coffee and owning a cat. I plan on getting a Samoyed in the near future.
