              I was born in Slovenia in 1996 and I currently work as a freelance full stack web developer, based in London. I also enjoy weightlifting and playing a good board game in my free time.

            <p class="light-text main-body text-center">
              I greatly enjoy learning about web development and constantly look to expand my knowledge by challenging myself with katas and projects. Oftentimes, I will look to create projects with completely different frameworks, so that I become more adaptable to whatever technology I will need to use.
            </p>

              I am a driven self-starter, having moved to the UK in March of 2020, I spent the majority of the dreaded COVID-19 lockdown learning about web development and programing in general. I finished <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript">CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a>, the Harvard Courses offered on edx.com. Since then, I’ve been working as a freelance web developer as well as working on personal projects expanding my skillset.

              Before moving to London, I worked as a mobile phone and tablet repair technician, working in a small team environment. I acquired efficient communication skills, as the day-to-day work required precise communication with both coworkers and customers. The work was very detail oriented and fast paced. Learning new skills and being adaptable was a daily requirement, as new phone models and repair techniques were introduced.
            </p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-center">  
              Outside of work, I used to be a competitive video game player. I reached the top 0.1% of a given player base in multiple video games, including League of Legends, Hearthstone, Gwent and Prismata, where I also won a world cup. I strongly enjoy games which are strategic and force me to think fast. Including playing Chess almost exclusively in blitz and bullet time modes.
            </p>
            <p class="light-text main-body text-center"> 
              Besides video games, I also enjoy modern board games, weightlifting, cooking, baking, drinking coffee and owning a cat. I would love to also have a Samoyed in the future.
